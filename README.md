A Comprehensive and Robust Framework for Identifying Promoters in Multiple Species

## Overview
 
The folder "data" is the data of the promoter, containing the sequences and labels of the independent tesst sets and training sets.  
The folder "EPdata" is the data of the enhancer and promoter, containing the sequences of the independent tesst sets and training sets. The first half of each file is labeled 1, and the second half is labeled 0.  
The file "index_promoters.txt" and "word2vec_promoters.txt" are benchmark files used to extract word2vec features.  
The file "RF.py" is the code of the random forest model.  
The file "CNN.py" is the code of the CNN model.  
The file "Weighted_average.py" is the code of the weighted average algorithm.  
The file "main.py" is the code of the entire model.
